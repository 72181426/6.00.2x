When does Dynamic Programming work?

1. Optimal substructure
    A globally optimal solution can be found by combining optimal solutions to local subproblems.
    Example : For x > 1, fib(x) = fib(x-1) + fib(x-2)

2. Overlapping subproblems
    Finding an optimal solution involves solving the same problem multiple times
    Compute fib(x) or many times
